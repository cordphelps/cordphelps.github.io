# pasfrais: alternately viewed as an App Starter Kit

My app building inspiration was Michael Mahemoff's book, [Ajax Design Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596101800.do), which I read on the way to deal with some enterprise IT 'cloud' service delivery issues. I had minimal knowledge of the coding world; but after a long, personal hackathon, I shipped an iOS app, ['pasfrais'](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pasfrais/id925137274?ls=1&mt=8), that exhibits weaknesses, but satisfies my design goals fairly well. 

Open source software is an interesting concept, and, in my narrow, app development case, I realized that the source could repesent a 'starter kit' for anyone wanted to build their own html5 app. So, I offer [pasfrais](https://github.com/pasfrais/gae) as a launchpad for your exploration into html5 front-end + back-end services. Undoubtedly, you will find bugs, inconsistency, and lack of professional standards; sorry about that. 

Please enjoy the work, leverage it to build something great. 

Before you start, get comfortable with a few things: 

- emacs (just kidding!)
- [sublime text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) 
- [github](https://github.com/)
- [bash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))
- [html5 (html, javascript, css)](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/) 
- before going further, internalize concepts of [responsive design](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design)
- [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) (a lightweight html5 debugging space)
- [golang](https://golang.org/)
- [app engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs)
- [phoneGap Build](https://build.phonegap.com/apps)
- [photoshop](http://www.photoshop.com/) 
- [stackoverflow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow)
- [and general comments on the mobile platform](http://www.addthis.com/blog/2014/10/27/7-things-to-consider-when-making-ios-and-android-apps-with-cordova-or-phonegap/)

As soon as you have your prototype running, read [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025832.do) by Addy Osmani.
