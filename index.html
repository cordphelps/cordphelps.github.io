#  pasfrais manages the anonymous collection and presentation of near real time, geo-located, public domain images. 

<br></br>

To reference the image, you may simply make a note of the shortURL and freely use it elsewhere. However, 
<br></br>
this image does not persist, the pasfrais service removes the image content and all references to the image after 
<br></br>
about 1 hour.
