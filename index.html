# pasfrais, an app starter kit

I decided to build an app just because. Actually, my inspiration was Michael Mahemoff's book, [Ajax Design Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596101800.do), which I read on the way to consult on some enterprise IT 'cloud' service delivery issues. I had minor knowledge of the coding world; I admit I knew a few emacs commands, but I was, and am, uncomfortable with pointers.

After many months of learning, I shipped an app, 'pasfrais', that exhibits weaknesses, but satisfies my design goals fairly well. And, in retrospect, I noticed several things about the app development ecosystem and about myself. 

Open source software is a very cool concept, and, in my narrow, app development case, I realized that exposing the un-obfuscated, fully commented and wartified source could repesent a 'starter kit' for anyone wanted to build their own html5 app. So, I offer [pasfrais](https://github.com/pasfrais/gae) as a launchpad for your exploration into html5 front-end + back-end services. Undoubtedly, you will find bugs, inconsistency, and lack of professional standards; I'm not a coder and don't aspire to be one. 

Please enjoy the work, leverage it to build something great. 



##  [pasfrais](http://pasfrais.cc/) manages the anonymous collection and presentation of near real time, geo-located, public domain images. 

<br></br>

To reference the image, you may simply make a note of the shortURL and freely use it elsewhere. However, 
<br></br>
this image does not persist, the pasfrais service removes the image content and all references to the image after 
<br></br>
about 1 hour.
