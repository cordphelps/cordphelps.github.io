#  pasfrais manages the anonymous collection and presentation of near real time, geo-located, public domain images. 

To reference the image, you may simply make a note of the shortURL and freely use it elsewhere. However, this image does not persist, the pasfrais service removes the image content and all references to the image after about 1 hour.
